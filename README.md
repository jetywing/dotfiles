# My Config

Is really nothing special. I admit that I haphazardly throw these things
together as I try to keep up with my life. There are definitely things that
could be better and it only needs to be good enough to not get in my way and be
better than vscode for now.

Is there a fix for the typescript lsp yet tho?
